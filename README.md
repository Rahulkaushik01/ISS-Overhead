# ISS-Overhead
🚀 Tracking the ISS with Python! 🌍🔭
While exploring free APIs, I came across the International Space Station (ISS) tracking API and thought—why not build something cool? So, I created a Python script that notifies me via email when the ISS is passing overhead at night! ✉️✨
What this project does:
✅ Fetches real-time ISS location using Open Notify’s ISS API
 ✅ Retrieves sunrise & sunset times for my location using Sunrise-Sunset API
 ✅ Converts UTC time to Indian Standard Time (IST) for accuracy ⏳🇮🇳
 ✅ Sends an email alert when the ISS is visible in the night sky 📩👀
Technologies Used:
🔹 Python 🐍
 🔹 Requests (for API calls)
 🔹 Datetime & Timedelta (for time conversion)
 🔹 SMTP (to send email alerts)
 🔹 Time.sleep (for periodic ISS checks)
This was a fun project that combines space science, APIs, and automation! 🌌🚀 If you’re into Python and real-time tracking, this is something you should try!
